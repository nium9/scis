Searchlight Inefficient Compression Scheme
==========================================

Write a compression and decompression algorithm for SICS which works as follows:

Find the most popular characters, and in order of popularity assign them a hex value 0 to E, F0 to FE, FF0 to FFE, etc.
Compress the message by replacing characters with their assigned value.

Test case:
'''
text = r"Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail. Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail."
